# Vimmy - A Simple Notepad with Vim Motions

Vimmy is a lightweight notepad application built with **Qt and C++**, featuring **Vim-like motions** for efficient text navigation and editing. It combines the simplicity of a traditional notepad with the power of Vim’s movement commands, making it ideal for users who prefer modal editing in a minimal GUI.

## ✨ Features
- Basic Vim motions (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `o`, `O`, `i`, `I`, etc.)
- Visual mode support (unfortunately current version doesn't support yanking or putting/pasting, but Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V / etc.. are working in Insert mode only)
- Simple and lightweight UI powered by Qt
- Designed for speed and efficiency

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Support for more advanced Vim commands
- Improved text manipulation (deletion, selection, and insertion modes)
- Customizable keybindings
- Syntax highlighting (optional)

## 🛠️ Building & Running
